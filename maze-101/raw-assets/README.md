# Source artwork

Files under `raw-assets/` are editable/source artwork for this example. They are
not game-package assets and are not copied into the built game. Runtime-ready
files belong under `assets/` and must use a format supported by the game
package and engine.

## Rocks

`blender/rocks.blend` is the upstream Blender source for three rock models in
the Maze World repository. It is retained here as source artwork; Cubacadabra does not
yet load general world meshes, so no runtime mesh is included. When that path
is available, export the selected prop to a validated GLB under
`assets/meshes/` and reference it through the game's mesh-instance schema.
